==== Aliens and Human Offshoots

You can find generic aliens and sample characteristic sets in the Non-Human Races chapter. You can also use the character packages in those chapters and combine them with the generic people listed here to create alien versions of each profession.

==== Animals

Characters may also interact with animals from time to time. Remember that, although clever, most animals are not as intelligent as Humans are. They donâ€™t actively use skills, though they may have some to represent their unconscious use of them, such as willpower to resist being told what to do. They may have Technical attribute of 0D. A Mechanical attribute of 1D indicates that the animal has the capacity to be trained to push buttons. Animals usually decide on the best course of action that will lead to their own survival, unless they are trained otherwise.
